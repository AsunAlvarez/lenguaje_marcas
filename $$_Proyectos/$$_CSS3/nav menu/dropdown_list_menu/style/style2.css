/*
Let’s begin the CSS by getting the basic dropdown 
functionality working. With CSS specificity and 
advanced selectors we can target individual elements 
buried deep in the HTML structure without the need 
for extra IDs or classes. First hide the sub menus 
by targeting any UL’s within a UL with the display:none; 
declaration. In order to make these menus reappear 
they need to be converted back to block elements on hover 
of the LI. The > child selector makes sure only 
the child UL of the LI being hovered is targeted, 
rather than all sub menus appearing at once.
*/
nav ul ul {
	display: none;
}

nav ul li:hover > ul {
	display: block;
}



/*
We can then start to style up the main navigation 
menu with the help of CSS3 properties such as gradients, 
box shadows and border radius. Adding position:relative; 
will allow us to absolutely position the sub menus 
according to this main nav bar, then display:inline-table 
will condense the width of the menu to fit. 
The clearfix style rule will clear the floats used 
on the subsequent list items without the use 
of overflow:hidden, which would hide 
the sub menus and prevent them from appearing.

The individual menu items are then styled up with CSS rules
added to the <li> and the nested anchor. 
In the browser this will make the link 
change to a blue gradient background and white text.

/*
The main navigation bar is now all styled up, 
but the sub menus still need some work. 
They are currently inheriting styles from their
parent elements, so a change of background 
and the removal of the border-radius and 
padding fixes their appearance. 
To make sure they fly out underneath the main menu 
they are positioned absolutely 100% from 
the top of the UL (ie, the bottom).
The LI’s of each UL in the sub menu don’t need
floating side by side, instead they’re listed 
vertically with thin borders separating each one.
 A quick hover effect then darkens the background to 
 act as a visual cue.
