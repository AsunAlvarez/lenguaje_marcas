/*
Let’s begin the CSS by getting the basic dropdown 
functionality working. With CSS specificity and 
advanced selectors we can target individual elements 
buried deep in the HTML structure without the need 
for extra IDs or classes. First hide the sub menus 
by targeting any UL’s within a UL with the display:none; 
declaration. In order to make these menus reappear 
they need to be converted back to block elements on hover 
of the LI. The > child selector makes sure only 
the child UL of the LI being hovered is targeted, 
rather than all sub menus appearing at once.
